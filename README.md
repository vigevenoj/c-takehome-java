# Assignment
Create a utility using the language/tools of your choice that takes a ZIP-code, then outputs the city name, current temperature, time zone, and general elevation at the location with a user-friendly message. For example, “At the location $CITY\_NAME, the temperature is $TEMPERATURE, the timezone is $TIMEZONE, and the elevation is $ELEVATION”.


Use the Open WeatherMap current weather API to retrieve the current temperature and city name. You will be required to sign up for a free API key.
Use the Google Time Zone API to get the current timezone for a location. You will again need to register a “project” and sign up for a free API key * with Google.
Use the Google Elevation API to retrieve elevation data for a location.

# Backend developers
Your utility can accept ZIP-code as a command line parameter and simply write its output to the console/STDOUT/STDERR once retrieved. Node or Java are preferred but not required.

# Frontend developers
Create an HTML page which allows input of the ZIP-code, and writes the required output message to the page once it is retrieved. Backbone or Marionette are preferred but not required.


Note that Open WeatherMap will not allow CORS requests from any location directly from the browser, so we’ve made the following backend proxy available for you to use.

In place of “http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5...”, substitute:
https://api.develop.apps.cayuse.com/testproxy/data/2.5...


The same is true for Google APIs, so use the following proxy when calling directly from the browser:

In place of “https://maps.googleapis.com/maps...”, substitute:
https://api.develop.apps.cayuse.com/testproxy/maps…

Feel free to pick one assignment or the other (either frontend or backend). If you’re feeling ambitious and have time, try to complete the frontend assignment without using the provided proxies.
